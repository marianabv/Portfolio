## About Me
I am a Certified Translator (English-Spanish) with an IT background and Tester Jr. In addition to my technical skills, I have acquired several transferable skills during my Translation studies. For instance, good written communication in Spanish and English, curiosity, communication skills, teamwork, research methods, correct citation practices (APA),  problem solving, attention to detail and responsibility to met due dates. However, I am a lifelong learner since I firmly believe knowledge is a bottomless fountain, and it will never be too much, whether it is about languages or IT.
